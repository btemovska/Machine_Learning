Asked ChatGPT why should we use sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler?

The StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing is used in machine learning and data preprocessing. The process ensures that your data is centered around 0 with a standard deviation of 1, which often improves the performance of many machine learning models, especially those that are sensitive to the scale of the input features, such as:
- Linear Regression: Helps ensure that the model treats each feature equally.
- Logistic Regression: Assumes features are on a similar scale for better performance.
- Support Vector Machines (SVM): Sensitive to the scale of the data and performs better when the data is standardized.
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Distance-based algorithms like KNN are highly affected by the scale of the data.
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Assumes that the data is centered and scaled.

The formula used is:
    z-score is z = (x-Œº)/œÉ   (where x is the original feature, ùúá Œº is the mean of the feature, and ùúé œÉ is the standard deviation)

When do we know to use Scaler: 
- Especially around the models listed above, ex. KNN deals with distance (cm vs m)
- Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosted Trees are generally not affected by feature scaling as they are based on hierarchical splitting and not distance measures.
